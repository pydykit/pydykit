# Statement of need

- General introduction
- Classification of numerical time integrators:
  - _Geometric_ or _structure-preserving_ integration [@hairer_geometric_2006].
  - _Energy-momentum_ (EM) methods using _discrete gradients_ (see, e.g. [@gonzalez_time_1996])
    or variational integrators [@lew2016brief], [@marsden_discrete_2001],
    which have been extended to DAEs in [@leyendecker_variational_2008].
- List alternative packages and highlight what they lack, i.e., which gap is closed by `pydykit`.

## Applicability

- System classification:
  - Hamiltonian dynamics with or without constraints [@leimkuhler_simulating_2005], also systems governed by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) [@kunkel_differential-algebraic_2006] are feasible.
  - Rigid body dynamics in terms of _directors_ [@betsch2001constrained].
  - Simulation of _port-Hamiltonian_ systems [@duindam_modeling_2009].

## Motivation by example

## Usage so far

`pydykit` has been recently used in the authors works (among others [@kinon_ggl_2023] and [@kinon_structure_2023]),
where numerical schemes based on a mixed extension due to Livens principle [@livens_hamiltons_1919]
have been derived for systems with holonomic constraints.
